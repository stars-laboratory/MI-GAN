# MI-GAN

A new GAN-based learning framework, MI-GAN is proposed by incorporating an efficient model-informed selector, which is designed to integrate the three proposed novel layer: the feasibility filter layer, the 
comparison layer, and the gradient-guided layer to ensure the feasibility and improve the optimality of generated solutions. In addition, a new recursive iteration algorithm is also proposed to further reduce the bias between selected 
solutions and optimal solutions.
